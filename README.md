This repository contains the analysis and training of different architectures for a denoising autoencoder on the CIFAR-10 dataset of images.
Therefore, given images created with random masks, the two Autoencoders considered, namely a simple convolutional NN and a U-net with skip connections, are trained to perform image inpainting on the masked images.
